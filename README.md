# Algo Labs

A collection of algorithm and data structure labs, exercises, and demos for learning and practicing fundamental computer science concepts. This repository is organized by lab and algorithm type, with each folder containing relevant code, documentation, and resources.

## Project Structure

```
algo-labs/
  insertion sort/         # Insertion sort implementation and README
  merge sort/            # Merge sort implementation and README
  selection sort/        # Selection sort implementation and README
  lab01/ - lab09/        # Lab assignments with questions and resources
```

### Sorting Algorithms

- **insertion sort/**: Contains `insertionSort.js` and a README explaining the algorithm.
- **merge sort/**: Contains `mergeSort.js` and a README explaining the algorithm.
- **selection sort/**: Contains `selectionsort.js` and a README explaining the algorithm.

### Labs

- **lab01/ - lab09/**: Each folder contains a `lab.md` with assignment instructions, and some may include additional resources (e.g., PDFs, images).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running JavaScript sorting demos)
