C-2.1 Describe, in pseudo-code, a link-hopping method for finding the middle node of a doubly linked list with header and trailer sentinels, and an odd number of real nodes between them. (Note: This method can only use link-hopping, i.e., the methods before and after; it cannot use a counter.) What is the running time of this method?
